# [IMPORTANT UPDATE]

~~*A clone library called **SwiftRank is pointing to our model buckets, we are working on a interim solution to avoid this stealing**. Thank you for patience and understanding.*~~

This issue is resolved. The models are in HF now. **Please upgrade to continue** pip install -U flashrank. Thank you for your patience and understanding

# üèéÔ∏è FlashRank
Ultra-lite &amp; Super-fast Python library to add re-ranking to your existing search &amp; retrieval pipelines. It is based on SoTA cross-encoders, with gratitude to all the model owners.

1. ‚ö° **Ultra-lite**: 
    - **No Torch or Transformers** needed. Runs on CPU.
    - Boasts the **tiniest reranking model in the world, ~4MB**.
    
2. ‚è±Ô∏è **Super-fast**:
    - Rerank speed is a function of **# of tokens in passages, query + model depth (layers)**
    - To give an idea, the Time taken by the example (in code) using the default model is below.
    - <center><img src="./images/time.png" width=600/></center>
    - Detailed benchmarking, TBD

3. üí∏ **$ concious**:
    - **Lowest $ per invocation:** Serverless deployments like Lambda are charged by memory & time per invocation*
    - **Smaller package size** = shorter cold start times, quicker re-deployments for Serverless.

4. üéØ **Based on SoTA Cross-encoders and other models**:
    - How good are Zero-shot rerankers - look at the reference section.
    - Below are the list of models supported as of now.
        * `ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-2-v2` (default) [Model card](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-2)
        * `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2` [Model card](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2)
        * `rank-T5-flan` (Best non cross-encoder reranker) [Model card](https://huggingface.co/bergum/rank-T5-flan)
        * `ms-marco-MultiBERT-L-12`  (Multi-lingual, [supports 100+ languages](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md#list-of-languages))
        * `ce-esci-MiniLM-L12-v2` [FT on Amazon ESCI dataset](https://github.com/amazon-science/esci-data) (This is interesting because most models are FT on MSFT MARCO Bing queries) [Model card](https://huggingface.co/metarank/ce-esci-MiniLM-L12-v2)
    - Models in roadmap:
        * InRanker
    - Why only sleeker models? Reranking is the final leg of larger retrieval pipelines; idea is to avoid any extra overhead, especially for user-facing scenarios. To that end, models with tiny footprints that don't need any specialized hardware and yet offer competitive performance are chosen. Feel free to raise issues to add support for new models as you see fit.


## üöÄ Installation:
```python 
pip install flashrank
```

## Usage:
```python
from flashrank import Ranker, RerankRequest

# Nano (~4MB), blazing fast model & competitive performance (ranking precision).
ranker = Ranker()

or 

# Small (~34MB), slightly slower & best performance (ranking precision).
ranker = Ranker(model_name="ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2", cache_dir="/opt")

or 

# Medium (~110MB), slower model with best zeroshot performance (ranking precision) on out of domain data.
ranker = Ranker(model_name="rank-T5-flan", cache_dir="/opt")

or 

# Medium (~150MB), slower model with competitive performance (ranking precision) for 100+ languages  (don't use for english)
ranker = Ranker(model_name="ms-marco-MultiBERT-L-12", cache_dir="/opt")
```

## Deployment patterns
#### How to use it in an AWS Lambda function?
In AWS or other serverless environments, the entire VM is read-only, so you might have to create your 
custom dir. You can do so in your Dockerfile and use it to load the models (and eventually as a cache between warm calls). You can do it during init with the cache_dir parameter. 

```python
ranker = Ranker(model_name="ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2", cache_dir="/opt")
```
